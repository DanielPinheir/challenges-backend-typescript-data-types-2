# Challenge 01

## Reading and Writing to Files

Implement two functions, one for reading and one for writing to files. The reading function must read a file called  `bd.json` and return the contents of the file and the writing function must write in the `bd.json` file the content informed as the function's argument and must not return anything.

The library for reading and writing files will be `fs` and will be able to use synchronous functions.

The program must use TypeScript and all variables, parameters and function returns must be properly typed.

It is not necessary to transpile the code.
