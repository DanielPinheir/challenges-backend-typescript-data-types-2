## User Update and Details

Implement two functions, one to update user information and one to drill down the user.

To update or detail the user must search for it, using the file reading function, through the `cpf` property in the `bd.json` file and the update data must be persisted in this same file.

The structure of the object with the user's information must follow the same as the registration, previously implemented.

The update user function should return the updated user.

Note:

The program must use TypeScript and all variables, parameters and function returns must be properly typed.

It is not necessary to transpile the code.

Test with other examples.

Commit the result.
