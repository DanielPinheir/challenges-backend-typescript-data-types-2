# Challenge 04

## Delete User

Implement a function that allows you to delete a user. To exclude the user must search for it, using the file read function, through the `cpf` property in the `bd.json` file and the exclusion data must be removed from the file.

The function should return the deleted user object.

Obs.:

The program must use TypeScript and all variables, parameters and function returns must be properly typed.

It is not necessary to transpile the code.

Test with other examples.

Commit the result.
